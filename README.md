# SimpleViewer
Simple Viewer is a minimalist WPF media browser that lets you flip through photos and videos fullscreen. Pick a folder or drag one in, filter by media type, run timed slideshows, loop videos seamlessly, and soft-delete files into a _delete_ holding folder—all controlled via keyboard shortcuts for a distraction-free viewing experience.
